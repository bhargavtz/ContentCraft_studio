## Installation üíª

Follow these steps to get ContentCraft Studio up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhargavtz/ContentCraft_studio.git
    cd ContentCraft_studio
    ```


2.  **Restore NuGet packages**:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3.  **Build the project**:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The application uses `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json` for configuration. You will need to configure your MongoDB connection string and Gemini API key.

1.  **Open `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Development.json`**:

    ```json
    {
      "Logging": {
        "LogLevel": {
          "Default": "Information",
          "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
        }
      },
      "AllowedHosts": "*",
      "MongoDb": {
        "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
        "DatabaseName": "ContentCraftDb"
      },
      "Gemini": {
        "ApiKey": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
      },
      "Auth0": {
        "Domain": "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN_HERE",
        "ClientId": "YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
        "ClientSecret": "YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE"
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Update the following**:
    *   `MongoDb:ConnectionString`: Set this to your MongoDB connection string. If running locally, `mongodb://localhost:27017` is often the default.
    *   `MongoDb:DatabaseName`: The name of the database to use (e.g., `ContentCraftDb`).
    *   `Gemini:ApiKey`: Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google Gemini API key.
    *   `Auth0:Domain`, `Auth0:ClientId`, `Auth0:ClientSecret`: If using Auth0 for authentication, configure these values. Otherwise, you might need to remove or adjust the authentication setup in `Program.cs`.
